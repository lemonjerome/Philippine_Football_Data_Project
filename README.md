# Philippine Football Data Project

This is a beginner project focusing on data exploration and visualization using Python. SQL concepts were used to alter tables and create new ones.

## Dataset Selection

The dataset used in this project is the from ...insert link... which shows the results of international football games from 1872 to 2024. The dataset contains three csv files: results.csv, goalscorers.csv, and shootouts.csv.

**NOTE: Based on research and personal knowledge, the results for teh Philippines is not complete. This project only exhibits the concepts and technical ability for data exploration and visualization. The interpretations of the data may not be accurate because of the incomplete dataset.**

## Project Execution

### Win-Lose-Draw vs Time

The first visualization is a line graph that shows the number of wins, losses, and draws of the Philippines over the years.

...insert image...

The line representing the Losses has a steeper incline and a higher starting point than the other two lines. This suggest a faster lose rate than win or draw.

### Philippine Goal Scorers

The second visualization is a horizintal bar graph of the players that scored for the Philippines

...insert image...

We see that the top goal scorers are Ángel Guirado and Stephan Schröck with 4 goals each.

### Goals Scored-Conceded by 15-minute Intervals in One Ga

The third visualization is a bar graph that shows the number of goals scored and conceded by 15 minute intervals.

...insert image...

We see that we concede the most during the second interval [15th to 29th minute]. We concede the most goals in a regular match with 90 minutes during second half [45th to 89th minute]. This suggest a collapse in the latter part of the games.
